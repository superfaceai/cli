# Superface CLI

**Let AI connect the APIs for you.**

[![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/superfaceai/cli/main.yml)](https://github.com/superfaceai/cli/actions/workflows/main.yml)
[![Stable Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/superfaceai/cli?label=homebrew)](#install)
[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@superfaceai/cli)](LICENSE)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3C%2F%3E-Typescript-blue)

Superface CLI abstracts APIs into the business cases you need. Point at API docs,
state your desired use case, let AI create an integration code, then use it
in your application. You remain in control of the code, and your app communicates
directly with your chosen APIs without any middlemen or proxy.

## `superface map PROVIDERNAME [PROFILEID]`

Creates a new (or updates an existing) Comlink Map that maps the use case to the selected API provider. After Map is available, the integration is ready to be used by our WASM OneSDK. You should check security, integration parameters and input in the created files before execution. The created Comlinks can be tested by running `superface execute` command

```
USAGE
  $ superface map PROVIDERNAME [PROFILEID] [LANGUAGE] [-q] [--noColor] [--noEmoji] [-h]

  -q, --quiet  When set to true, disables the shell echo output of action.
  --noColor    When set to true, disables all colored output.
  --noEmoji    When set to true, disables displaying emoji in output.

DESCRIPTION
  Creates a new (or updates an existing) Comlink Map that maps the use case to the selected API provider. After Map is

  -q, --quiet  When set to true, disables the shell echo output of action.
  --noColor    When set to true, disables all colored output.

DESCRIPTION
  Creates new Comlink Profile for your use case based on the selected API. Comlink Profile defines the interface of the
  API integration. Use name of API provider as the first argument followed by the description of your use case. You need
  to run `superface prepare` command before running this command.

EXAMPLES
  $ superface new swapi "retrieve character's homeworld by their name"

  $ superface new resend "Send email to user"
```

## `superface prepare URLORPATH [NAME]`

Learns API from the documentation and prepares the API metadata.

```
USAGE
  $ superface prepare URLORPATH [NAME] [-q] [--noColor] [--noEmoji] [-h]

ARGUMENTS
  URLORPATH  URL or path to the API documentation.
  NAME       API name. If not provided, it will be inferred from URL or file name.

FLAGS
  -h, --help   show CLI help
  -q, --quiet  When set to true, disables the shell echo output of action.
  --noColor    When set to true, disables all colored output.
  --noEmoji    When set to true, disables displaying emoji in output.

DESCRIPTION
  Learns API from the documentation and prepares the API metadata.

  The supported documentation formats are:
  - OpenAPI specification (via URL or local file)
  - documentation hosted on ReadMe.io (via URL)
  - plain text (see below)

  If you want to use plain text documentation you need to format the docs with **the separator**. The documentation
  conventionally consists of various topics, usually set apart by separate pages or big headings. They might be
  _authentication, rate limiting, general rules, API operations (sometimes grouped by resources)_.

  It's highly recommended each of these topics (or chunks) is set apart in the docs provided for Superface, too. For
  that, we use _the separator_.

  The separator is a long `===========` ended with a newline. Technically 5 _equal_ characters are enough to form a
  separator. The API docs ready for the ingest might look something like the following:

  `
  # Welcome to our docs
  (...)
  ================================
  # API Basics
  (...)
  ================================
  # Authorizing Requests
  (...)
  ================================
  # /todos/:id/items
  This endpoint lists all items (...)
  ================================
  (...)
  `
  This command prepares a Provider JSON metadata definition that can be used to generate the integration code. Superface
  tries to fill as much as possibe from the API documentation, but some parts are required to be filled manually. You
  can find the prepared provider definition in the `superface/` directory in the current working directory.

EXAMPLES
  $ superface prepare https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/main/APIs/openai.com/1.2.0/openapi.yaml

  $ superface prepare https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/main/APIs/openai.com/1.2.0/openapi.yaml openai

  $ superface prepare path/to/openapi.json

  $ superface prepare https://workable.readme.io/reference/stages workable
```

_See code: [dist/commands/prepare.ts](https://github.com/superfaceai/cli/tree/main/src/commands/prepare.ts)_

## `superface whoami`

```
USAGE

FLAGS
  -h, --help   show CLI help
  -q, --quiet  When set to true, disables the shell echo output of action.
  --noColor    When set to true, disables all colored output.
  --noEmoji    When set to true, disables displaying emoji in output.

DESCRIPTION

## Development

When developing, start with cloning the repository using `git clone https://github.com/superfaceai/cli.git` (or `git clone git@github.com:superfaceai/cli.git` if you have repository access).

After cloning, the dependencies must be downloaded using `yarn install` or `npm install`.

Now the repository is ready for code changes.

The `package.json` also contains scripts (runnable by calling `yarn <script-name>` or `npm run <script-name>`):

- `test` - run all tests
- `lint` - lint the code (use `lint --fix` to run autofix)
- `format` - check the code formatting (use `firmat:fix` to autoformat)
- `prepush` - run `test`, `lint` and `format` checks. This should run without errors before you push anything to git.

Lastly, to build a local artifact run `yarn build` or `npm run build`.

To install a local artifact globally, symlink the binary (`ln -s bin/superface <target>`) into one of the following folders:

- `~/.local/bin` - local binaries for your user only (may not be in `PATH` yet)
- `/usr/local/bin` - system-wide binaries installed by the system administrator
- output of `yarn global bin` - usually the same as `/use/local/bin`

**Note**: The project needs to be built (into the `dist` folder) to run cli commands.

**Note**: You can change url of API requests by setting `SUPERFACE_API_URL` environment variable to desired base url.
